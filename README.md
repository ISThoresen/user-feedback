Allow users to submit feedback and bug reports anywhere on the site using an interactive feedback button.

## Description ##

With this plugin, users can send feedback using a dedicated feedback button on the front-end. They can highlight parts of the page and write an accompanying message.

Together with some helpful debug information like browser version, language and visited URL, the annotated screenshot is stored directly in WordPress. Each feedback is also sent to the blog administrator via email.

The user interface is built in a way to _guide_ the user through submitting his feedback easily and without distraction. Thanks to highly optimized JavaScript the plugin is very fast and convenient to use.
